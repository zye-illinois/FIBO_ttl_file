		"Asset Backed Securities, for example home equity loans (HEL), credit cards, etc. These are securities backed by receivables [payments] that are either secured (HEL) or unsecured (credit card), tranched on the basis of prepayment and default risks. Action: Determine where mobile home and second mortgage based securities fit in, and add to the relevant definition. Outcome: these would be specialised kinds of pools of loans and are therefore reflected by specific typs of Cash ABS, in the same way as Auto Loan ABS are defined. Note also that an issue of ABS certificates (contracts) may have different tranches which relate to these different kinds of loan, and other as yet undefined types of loan. These are capable of extension into indefinite numbers of loan types / pool types, so it would not be practical to include all the possibilities in the standard terms other than as selectable types of loan in the loan type selection data range."@en ,
		"The issuer of the (Cash) Asset Backed Security. This is generally a Special Purpose Vehicle set up by a corporation. Further details from riskglossary.com: To create an ABS, a corporation creates a special purpose vehicle to which it sells the assets. While is is common to speak of the corporation as the issuer of the ABS, legally, it is the trust or special purpose vehicle that is the issuer. It sells securities to investors. To protect investors from possible bankruptcy of the corporation, there are three legal safeguards: - Transfer of assets from the corporation is a non-recourse, true sale. - Investors receive a perfected interest in the assets' cash flows. - A non-consolidation legal opinion is obtained certifying that assets of the trust or special purpose vehicle cannot be consolidated with the corporation's assets in the event of bankruptcy. These same safeguards allow the corporation to remove the assets from its balance sheet. The corporation generally continues to service the assets - collecting interest and principal payments, pursuing delinquencies, etc. It is paid out of asset cash flows for providing these ongoing services."@en

This is a method of providing investors with a relatively predictable repayment schedule, even though the underlying assets are nonamortizing. Controlled-amortization ABS resemble corporate bonds with a sinking fund. After a predetermined 'revolving' period during which only interest payments are made, these securities attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments that usually occur over less than a year. A risk inherent in this kind of ABS is an early amortization event. (See 'Early-Amortization Risk', on page 20.)" ;

The trust then creates and sells certificates backed by the credit card receivables to investors, which are predominately institutional investors. Very few credit card ABS are marketed to retail customers, primarily due to the complex nature of the transactions and the need to continually monitor various performance indices on the underlying receivables.

The financial institution retains legal ownership of the credit card accounts and can continue to change the terms on the accounts. Accounts corresponding to securitized loans are typically referred to as the designated accounts (or sometimes trust accounts). The initial outstanding balances on the designated accounts are sold to the trust as are the rights to any new charges on the designated accounts. Subsequently, as cardholder purchase activity generates more receivables on the designated accounts, these new receivables are purchased by the trust from the originating institution/seller/transferor. The trust uses the monthly principal payments received from the cardholders to acquire these new charges or receivables. When the securitization is initially set up, the originating institution/seller adds sufficient receivables to support the principal balance of the certificates plus an additional amount (seller's interest) that serves to absorb fluctuations in the outstanding balance of the receivables. The originating institution/seller will make subsequent additions to the trust in order to keep the seller's interest at the required level."@en ;

	fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote '''The inflation rate is used to define the factor or multiplier for the bond, that is the factor that you multiply the bond by. How this works is that you take the inflation rate when the security was issued, and the inflation rate at the present. The difference between these becomes the Factor, e.g. 100% -&gt; 101% gives 1% so for example for a $1000 issue - calculate the principal on which the interest is paid AND the principal from the point of view of how the principal is repaid. Some inflation bonds only do this on interest, some only on interest, but most apply it to the principal and interest. Coupon interest calculated based on the adjusted amount of the bond. so a fixed coupon rate is multiplied by e.g. 1010 in the example above. Variations e.g. Italy - daily published factor published for that bond, whereas other calculate based on underlying index. Typically a CPI or a statistical number generated by the govt. typically a lagging three month index. See UK bonds on this. US and Japanese ones - look at inflation rate 3 months prior. Unlike an Amortizing Security this principal value of the bond is increasing, whereas for and Amortizing, the principal is decreasing. In Canada, these are also referred to as "real return bonds". 
Further Notes:Additional review with OTPP May 05 2010 indicates that this is part of a classification of bonds where the principal amount itself varies according to some index, a point which was not understood at the original review session. Terms and labels revised to fit this picture.''' ;
