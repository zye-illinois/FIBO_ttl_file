In finance, the law of one price suggests that the securities of a CDO should have the same market value as its underlying collateral. In practice, this is often not the case. Accordingly, a CDO can represent a theoretical arbitrage. april 28 note: Does this have meaning for Cash CDO? Are these always? Arbitrage is there to exploit market inefficiencies. Would there not be some arbitrage exploited in the CDO. The definition here implies cash CDO only. not cler to reviewers what the ditinctio nis and whether these are mutually excluive. On eview is that the arb CDO has cash inflorws different to cash outflows, e.g. 9.5% v 9% with the 50bp taken as fees. So that might be Arb CDO. There is another type we hav emissed: like an arb CDO where there is instead a spread between in/out as above, you have instead a MArket Value CDO, where its base don the market value of the deal. Not clear how you are supposed to realized that value. you are supposed to realize the xxxx of securities .Seen both referred to. So is arb a risk management tool."@en ;

Similar to a traditional ABS, the CDO is a vehicle for it to do so. Balance Sheet CDO = Funded CDO. This is about whether or not ther is actual borrowing or lending underpinning the CDO. Does this have meaning in the context of synthetic CDO? It has meaning in the context of a sythetic CDO because you can constructt hat from a unifirm funding and use the CDSs to break up and creat the manyt risks. Derive the funds from a uniform source using CDSs. So that would be on Balance Sheet CDO. April 28 notes does Balance sheet CDPO have any meaning fo rCash =CDO? No. cash CDOs would have to have a balance sheet impact, so this distinction between Balance sheet and Arbittrrage only has meaning for Synthetics."@en ;

This is a type of asset-backed security and is constructed from a portfolio of fixed income assets including corporate loans and mortgage backed securities. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) issues notes to investors in order to raise funds that are invested in a portfolio of those fixed income assets, held by the SPV as collateral for the notes. Further notes: Collateralized Debt Obligation, for example, ABS CDO which consists of a portfolio of different ABS bonds, and the payments to the holders of these trust certificates are derived from the cash flows of the ABS bonds. This CDO instrument is part of a CDO issue, consisting of individual CDO instruments of a given seniority. Often referred to as tranches and slices (Investopedia). Investopedia: Similar in structure to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO), CDOs are unique in that they represent different types of debt and credit risk. In the case of CDOs, these different types of debt are often referred to as 'tranches' or 'slices'. Each slice has a different maturity and risk associated with it. The higher the risk, the more the CDO pays. Further details: Collateralized Debt obligations are securitized interests in pools of - generally non-mortgage - assets. Assets - called collateral - usually comprise loans or debt instruments. A CDO may be called a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO) if it holds only loans or bonds, respectively. Investors bear the credit risk of the collateral. Multiple tranches of securities are issued by the CDO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics."@en ;

If there are defaults or the CDO's collateral otherwise underperforms, scheduled payments to senior tranches take precedence over those of mezzanine tranches, and scheduled payments to mezzanine tranches take precedence over those to subordinated/equity tranches. Senior and mezzanine tranches are typically rated, with the former receiving ratings of A to AAA and the latter receiving ratings of B to BBB. The ratings reflect both the credit quality of underlying collateral as well as how much protection a given tranch is afforded by tranches that are subordinate to it."@en ;
